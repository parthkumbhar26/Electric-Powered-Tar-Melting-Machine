# Electric-Powered-Tar-Melting-Machine
Final Year Group Project 

---

## Project Overview
  The Electric Tar Melting Machine is designed as a modern, efficient alternative to traditional wood-fired tar heating used in road-repair applications. Conventional methods are slow, unsafe, difficult to control, and highly inefficient in fuel use and heat distribution.
This project introduces a compact, portable, electrically operated system that delivers faster melting, uniform heating, reduced operating cost, and improved worker safety.

- The machine utilizes a dual-heating system:

- Bottom induction heater for primary rapid heating

- Side nichrome heating coil for controlled secondary heating

The assembly is supported by glass-wool insulation, a durable plywood exterior, and an MS melting chamber that ensures thermal and structural stability.
Testing shows a major improvement: melting time drops from 96 minutes (traditional) to 22 minutes (electric), demonstrating clear gains in efficiency, control, and usability.

This solution is practical and field-ready, ideal for municipal road maintenance teams, contractors, and small-scale operations needing reliable, controlled tar melting with minimal fuel dependency.

## Features
- **Dual-Heating System**

  Bottom induction heater delivers fast primary heating, while the top-mounted nichrome coil provides controlled secondary heating and stabilizes the temperature profile inside the chamber.
- **Uniform Heat Distribution**

  Upward induction heat flow combined with top-coil radiation ensures consistent melting and eliminates cold spots within the tar chamber.
- **High-Efficiency Insulation**

  Glass-wool insulation minimizes heat loss, improves energy efficiency, and maintains steady operating temperatures during extended use.
- **Robust Material Construction**

  An MS chamber paired with an MS cylinder provides mechanical strength, thermal reliability, and durability under continuous high-temperature cycles.
- **Portable Design**

  PU wheels offer smooth mobility, allowing quick transportation and setup during on-site road maintenance tasks.

  ## Material Selection
- **Melting Chamber**

  Fabricated from mild steel (MS sheet) to provide durability, efficient heat conduction, and resistance to repeated thermal cycles during continuous melting operations.

- **Heating Coil** (Primary Heater)

  Nichrome coil mounted at the top of the chamber, selected for its high resistive heating capability, stable performance at elevated temperatures, and long operational life.

- **Induction System** (Secondary Heater)

  Bottom-mounted induction heater chosen for rapid supplementary heating and deeper heat penetration into the tar mass, improving overall melting speed.

- **Insulation Material**

  Glass wool placed between the chamber and outer structure to minimize heat loss, maintain consistent internal temperature, and enhance energy efficiency.

- **Outer Structure**

  Plywood housing that provides structural support, lowers external heat exposure, and increases operator safety during field use.

- **Mobility Components**

  PU wheels selected for durability, smooth movement on-site, and resistance to heat transferred through the base structure.

## Manufacturing Process
- **Chamber Fabrication** (MS Sheet)

  Cut the mild steel sheet to the required dimensions, then roll and weld it to form the melting chamber. Grind and finish welds to ensure a smooth internal surface for uniform heat flow.

- **Top Coil Mounting Structure**

  Fabricate an MS ring or bracket to support the top-mounted nichrome coil. Weld or fasten the structure securely to maintain proper coil position and mechanical stability.

- **Induction Base Support**

  Prepare a bottom MS plate or frame to seat the induction heating unit. Ensure accurate flatness and alignment with the chamber base to maximize heat transfer efficiency.

- **Insulation Installation**

  Pack glass wool uniformly between the inner chamber and the outer cylinder. Apply light compression to eliminate gaps while avoiding over-compaction that could reduce insulation performance.

- **Plywood Structural Housing**

  Cut and assemble plywood panels to create the external housing. Mount the insulated chamber assembly inside using brackets or fasteners, leaving only essential access points.

- **Mobility Integration**

  Fabricate the base frame sized for PU wheels, attach them securely, and ensure level alignment. Reinforce wheel joints to handle load and repeated movement.

- **Final Assembly and Mechanical Inspection**

  Inspect all welds, joints, and structural connections for accuracy and strength. Verify coil mounting alignment, insulation coverage, and chamber fit. Conduct a dry mechanical run to confirm stability and mobility before heating operations.

  ## Working Procedure
- **Loading the Cylinders**
  
  Tar-filled cylinders are placed upside down on the top section of the machine. This orientation allows softened tar to drip downward into the main chamber as heating begins.

- **Primary Heating** (Nichrome Coil)

  The top-mounted nichrome coil is activated first. It softens and loosens the tar inside the inverted cylinders, initiating the melting process.

- **Secondary Pre-Heating** (Induction Unit)

  After the initial softening stage, the bottom induction unit is switched on. This pre-heats the lower chamber and prepares it to efficiently receive the falling tar.

- **Tar Transfer to Main Chamber**

  As the tar inside the cylinders melts, it flows downward into the lower chamber. The process continues until each cylinder is completely emptied.

- **Main Melting Phase**

  The collected tar in the bottom chamber is heated to approximately 200°C. Both heating systems work together to maintain uniform temperature and ensure thorough melting.

- **Final Extraction**

  Once the tar reaches a fully melted, pourable consistency, it is discharged through the outlet or collected as required. The chamber is then inspected and prepared for the next operational cycle.

  ## Testing & Results
- **Traditional Method**

  - Tar cylinders were manually heated over an open wood fire.
  - Average melting time for 1 kg tar: ~96 minutes.
  - Melting was uneven, with frequent charring and inconsistent softening.
  - Operators were exposed to high heat, smoke, and fumes.
   Continuous wood consumption resulted in high operational cost and poor environmental conditions.

- **Electric Machine Testing**

  - Tar-filled cylinders were placed upside down and heated using the top nichrome coil (primary heater) and bottom induction heater (secondary heater).
  - Tar softened, flowed into the chamber, and reached full melt in ~22 minutes per kg.
  - Dual heating from top and bottom ensured uniform temperature distribution.
  - No flame or smoke exposure, greatly improving operator safety and comfort.
  - Average energy use was measured at ~0.63 kWh per melting cycle.
